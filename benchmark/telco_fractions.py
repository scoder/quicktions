""" Telco Benchmark for measuring the performance of Fraction calculations

http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/decimal/telco.html
http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/decimal/telcoSpec.html

A call type indicator, c, is set from the bottom (least significant) bit of the duration (hence c is 0 or 1).
A r, r, is determined from the call type. Those calls with c=0 have a low r: 0.0013; the remainder (‘distance calls’) have a ‘premium’ r: 0.00894. (The rates are, very roughly, in Euros or dollarates per second.)
A price, p, for the call is then calculated (p=r*n).
A basic tax, b, is calculated: b=p*0.0675 (6.75%), and the total basic tax variable is then incremented (sumB=sumB+b).
For distance calls: a distance tax, d, is calculated: d=p*0.0341 (3.41%), and then the total distance tax variable is incremented (sumD=sumD+d).
The total price, t, is calculated (t=p+b, and, if a distance call, t=t+d).
The total prices variable is incremented (sumT=sumT+t).
The total price, t, is converted to a string, s.
