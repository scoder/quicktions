Python's ``Fraction`` data type is an excellent way to do exact money
calculations and largely beats ``Decimal`` in terms of simplicity,
accuracy and safety.  Clearly not in terms of speed, though, given
the cdecimal accelerator in Py3.3+.

``quicktions`` is an adaptation of the original ``fractions`` module
(as included in CPython 3.7) that is compiled and optimised with
`Cython <http://cython.org/>`_ into a fast, native extension module.

Compared to the standard library ``fractions`` module in Py2.7 and
Py3.4, ``quicktions`` is currently about 10x faster, and still about
6x faster than the current version in Python 3.5.  It's also about
15x faster than the (Python implemented) ``decimal`` module in Py2.7.

For documentation, see the Python standard library's ``fractions``
module:
